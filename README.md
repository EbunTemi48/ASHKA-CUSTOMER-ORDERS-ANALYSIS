From the dashboard above, 

Take a look at how Ashka stores customers place their orders based on what is required of them, quantity, sales amount, and the profit made by the store.

•	A total of 101 orders were placed

•	389 quantity items were sold

•	sales revenue of 15,679

•	and profit of 4,192 was recorded.

## ANALYSIS AND INSIGHT
 There are months when sales was booming (Month of increase), which were March and June for Ashka, while losses were observed in July and August, which could be a result of seasonal fluctuations of some items resulting in low sales.
 
 Also, judging by the profit by cities (Pune, Jaipur, and Ahmedabad) recorded a notable profile while some were running at low profit, which points to us that some areas need strong presence and marketing improvements. 
 

 The interesting thing is the mode of payment; I am sure some of us are aware of this popular saying (what I ordered vs. what I got). This could be why most of the customers opted for cash on delivery.

## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
 As I reflect on the data, I was able to draw out the following to make strategic decision
 
•	The store should focus more on cities like Kolkata on promotion campaigns to boost sales.

•	The store should not relent on high-performing cities but continue to maintain customer engagement and loyalty.

•	Also, they should analyze reasons behind losses in low-performing months to create targeted seasonal offers or discounts.

•	They should build trust and loyalty with their customers to encourage digital payments to ensure flexibility & efficiency.
